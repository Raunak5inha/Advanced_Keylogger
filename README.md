Advanced Keylogger for Ethical Hacking
Instructor: Ermin Kreponic

•	Built an Advanced Keylogger using C++, capable of recording all the keyboard and mouse input.

•	Incorporated mail sending capabilities so we can schedule the Logfile to be sent via mail.

•	Analysed the Keylogger keeps the Logfile encrypted. Thus, created another program which was able to decrypt the logfile or encrypted files that the Keylogger actually sends on our end.
